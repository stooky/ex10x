Vibe coding is a new way of working with code where you collaborate with AI assistants to build software faster than ever before. Instead of writing every line yourself, you describe what you want and refine the output.

## What is Vibe Coding?

At its core, vibe coding is about establishing a productive flow between you and an AI coding assistant. You provide the direction, context, and quality control—the AI handles the implementation details.

This isn't about replacing your skills. It's about amplifying them.

## Getting Started

Here's how to begin your vibe coding journey:

### 1. Choose Your Tools

Start with an AI coding assistant that integrates with your workflow. Popular options include:

- Claude (via Claude Code or API)
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Continue

### 2. Learn to Communicate Effectively

The key to vibe coding is clear communication. When prompting:

- **Be specific** about what you want
- **Provide context** about your codebase
- **Iterate** on the output

### 3. Stay in Control

Remember, you're the developer. Always:

- Review generated code carefully
- Understand what the code does before using it
- Make adjustments as needed

## Practical Tips

Here are some techniques I use daily:

1. **Start with pseudocode** — Describe the logic you want before asking for implementation
2. **Break down complex tasks** — Smaller, focused requests get better results
3. **Use examples** — Show the AI what good output looks like
4. **Iterate quickly** — Don't aim for perfection on the first try
